# CVBuilder

This repository contains a simple CV improvement tool with a React frontend and Node.js backend.

## Upload directory

Uploaded CV files are stored inside the `data/` folder at the project root. If you want them to appear in your GitHub repository, commit and push the files in that directory.

## Sample CV JSON Structure

The `sample_cv_template.json` file at the project root demonstrates the fields our application expects when building a CV. You can use it as a reference for the ideal structure produced after parsing and followâ€‘up questions.
